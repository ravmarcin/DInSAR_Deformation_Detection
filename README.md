The main purpose of the application is the ability to define the location
of deformation in DInSAR images. It uses machine learning techniques,
in particular the methods of multiclass logistic regression.
In addition, the application allows you to:
- improvement of the regression model and validation,
- connecting models and changing model parameters,
- eliminating jumps in values on displacements images,
- identification of places with incorrect displacement (artifacts),
- estimation of the probability of the predicted classes,
- operating in UTM and WGS systems.
